# scribex
#### scribex - a localbased diary app that is written in Django framework. To install and launch it use the following commands

`python3 -m venv .venv | source ./.venv/bin/activate | python -m pip install -r requirments.txt | python scribex/manage.py migrate | python scribex/manage.py makemigrations | python manage.py createsuperuser`
